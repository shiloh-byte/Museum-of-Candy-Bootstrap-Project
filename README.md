# Museum-of-Candy-Bootstrap-Project
Project from Colt Steele's Udemy course. Uses HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript. 

This project is done before going through code along videos. My goal was to match it as close as possible
to the preview that was shown in the intro to the project video.

The hamburger button still doesn't work and the lollipop icon styles switch back to default styling whenever
the bootstrap class to hide this is added (lollipop style issue fixed 3-17-22).

also pictures are not originally from project file, they are added from Pixabay.com.
